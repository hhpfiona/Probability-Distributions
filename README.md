# Working with Probability Distributions in R [November 2023]

Welcome to the repository for my exploration of probability distributions using R! This project is a hands-on journey through the world of simulation, probability functions, and statistical analysis in R, designed to build proficiency with RStudio and reproducible workflows.

### Project Overview

This project involves:
- Simulating random experiments in R.
- Using R functions for various probability distributions (normal, binomial, Poisson, etc.).
- Applying statistical techniques to answer probability questions, derive cumulative distribution functions, and more.
- Visualizing data using histograms and Q-Q plots to understand distribution shapes and assess normality or fit to other probability models.

### What You’ll Find Here

**Key Files**:
- `prob-distribution.Rmd`: The R Markdown file containing all questions, code, and explanations.
- Example code for setting seeds to ensure reproducibility.
- R scripts that tackle problems ranging from simple probability calculations to more complex simulations.

### Skills and Concepts

This project covers:
- **R Programming**: Writing efficient and reproducible R code.
- **Statistical Distributions**: Working with normal, binomial, Poisson, Pareto, and other distributions.
- **Simulation**: Generating random data points and using simulation to approximate probabilities.
- **Data Visualization**: Using histograms and Q-Q plots to interpret data.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensuring the same results are obtained with repeated analyses using `set.seed()`.

### Why This Project?

I embarked on this project to deepen my understanding of how theoretical probability translates to real-world applications through simulation. It’s been an exciting way to bring abstract concepts to life using R, and I'm thrilled to share this journey with fellow learners and enthusiasts. Whether you're new to R or looking to refine your skills, I hope you find value in exploring this repository.

Feel free to fork, experiment, and share your insights or improvements! Let’s dive into the world of probability together.
